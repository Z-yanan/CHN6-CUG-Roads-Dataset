# CHN6-CUG-Roads-Dataset
Version 1.0

## 1.Overview
To advance the state of the arts in road extraction, CHN6-CUG Roads Dataset is constructed, which is a manually labeled pixel-level VHR satellite imagery. This data set is a new largescale satellite image data set of representative cities in China. The images are selected from six cities with different levels of urbanization, i.e., the Chaoyang area of Beijing, the Yangpu District of Shanghai, Wuhan city center, the Nanshan area of Shenzhen, the Shatin area of Hong Kong, and Macao.
